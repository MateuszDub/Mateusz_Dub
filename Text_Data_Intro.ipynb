Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\\n\\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \\n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\\nsummary of the answers).\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n"," \"From: lau@auriga.rose.brandeis.edu (frankie t. k. lau)\\nSubject: PC fastest line/circle drawing routines: HELP!\\nOrganization: Brandeis University\\nLines: 41\\n\\nhi all,\\n\\nIN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing\\n\\t  on SVGA graphics.\\n\\nCOMPLETE:\\n\\tI am thinking of a simple but fast molecular\\ngraphics program to write on PC or clones.
